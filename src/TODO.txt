Implement commands.
Additional commands:
 new file 'path'
 load file 'path'
 save file
 exit file
Make split handle quotes.

Bug fix:
 Need a separate function "read next inside item"
 and then the basic function "read next bit" should not care about whether it's inside page data or not, etc...

Future:
 + Handle track numbers.
 + More viewing options. For now I'll just have one default for each type.
